[Click here to visit the site.](https://bcristus.herokuapp.com)

Bavarian Cristus is a website created by Luciano Fern√°ndez with the purpouse of allowing all people interested in Jesus Christ, that also enjoy to take and share photos, and happen to be residents or visiting Bavaria, to share their pictures and thoughts about images shared by others.

Users of the website are able to see images and also upload their own taken photos to a Jesus statue, as long as they are taken within Bavaria.

They will be also able to tag the location of the photo. This will allow visitors to find exactly where the statue is located.

The post card contains an image and information about the author of the picture; !! those fields as well as messages could be printed or not upon request of the member using checkboxes. Members of the community can also comment and like other posts.

In this version, each post have a location tag to locate the statue. !! in future releases, the user will be able to tag the exact location, this is with the purpouse of making routes for tourists and groups of visitors and guided tours.

Footer; in the footer there's access to social network and the traditional rights reservation statement.

The website is written within github development enviroment, using Django as MVC (MVT) framework and deployed to heroku. All images and static files are being hosted in Cloudinary.

## Working Methodology

In order to achieve this first release, i set up tasks having in mind an Agile mindset and stablishing goals to be completed within weekly iterations.

Placing myself in the user's position, and anticipating the user's wants and needs, i made myself the following questions:

Why would a user want to visit our blog?
What will make them return
What do i want to see when I visit a blog
What would make me return

From those answer I did set up 17 issues in GitHub as User Stories.
