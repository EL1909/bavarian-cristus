Bavarian Cristus is a website created by Luciano Fern√°ndez with the purpouse of allowing all people interested in Jesus Christ, that also enjoy to take and share photos, and happen to be residents or visiting Bavaria, to share their pictures and thoughts about images shared by others.

Users of the website are able to see images and also upload their own taken photos to a Jesus statue, as long as they are taken within Bavaria.

They will be also able to tag the location of the photo. This will allow visitors to find exactly where the statue is located.
