            <p> My name is Luciano, i came to Bavaria for the first time in 2013. Since the beginning i noticed that there are Jesus crucified statues everywhere. </p>
            <br>
            <p>There's not a single town with at least one of them; curious thing to see because here, there's many towns one after another.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Now I'm a Bavarian resident and since i have feel so welcomed in here, i have decided to create this community for sharing our common admiration to his figure. </p> 
            <br>
            <p>Personally, i rather to look at him as a Friend, and not hanging from a cross, as a reminder to what happened to the last one that came around claiming to be a Messiah.</p>
