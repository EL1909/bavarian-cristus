Bavarian Cristus is a website created by Luciano Fern√°ndez with the purpouse of allowing all people interested in Jesus Christ, that also enjoy to take and share photos, and happen to be residents or visiting Bavaria, to share their pictures and thoughts about images shared by others.

Users of the website are able to see images and also upload their own taken photos to a Jesus statue, as long as they are taken within Bavaria.

They will be also able to tag the location of the photo. This will allow visitors to find exactly where the statue is located.

In the home page, visitors can watch a list of post; each card appears to be a traditional PostCard. Among others, an expected update of this website will be allowing to create a PDF file from those post card; to be shared or even sent per post upon request.

<img src="readme/PostCard.png">

The post card contains an image and information about the author of the picture; those fields as well as messages could be printed or not upon request of the member using checkboxes. Members of the community can also comment and like other posts.

In this version, each post have a location tag to locate the statue. In future releases, the user will be able to tag the exact location, this is with the purpouse of making routes for tourists and groups of visitors and guided tours.

In the footer there's access to social network and the traditional rights reservation statement.

The website is written within github development enviroment, using Django as MVC (MVT) framework and deployed to Heroku. All images and static files are being hosted in Cloudinary.

## Assessment Results

This is the second version i make of this website, the following list contains notes from assessor and steps taken to deliver a solution.

- All text needs to have a positive font color contrast ratio.
    - Modified color scheme on text areas.
- Favicon should be included for the website.
    - Added favicon.ico to root directory.
- The website is responsive but users need to be allowed to store and manipulate data records about a particular domain.
    - Responsiveness improved.
- Ensure that all user stories have a descriptive user acceptance criteria.
    - To be implemented in future projects.
- Error pages should be implemented.
    - Error pages are implemented.
- Clicking on like on a post results in a not found error.
    - Links are verified.
- Additionally all attempts to create a post resulted in a not found error when the post was clicked on.
    - This error was caused due a permission configuration, now post can be published without admin's approval.
- The CRUD logic for users to create, locate, display, edit and delete records is present, but not fully implemented to work as expected.
    - Whole CRUD operation was reviewed and fixed for publishing posts.
- Implement form validation and verification so that users cannot submit blank or incorrectly filled forms. 
    - Form validation implemented in text field and location when post are created.
- All attempts to create a post resulted in a not found error when the post was clicked on.
    - This error was caused due a permission configuration, now post can be published without admin's approval.
- The testing process needs to be documented in a little more detail to explain all the manual and automated tests undertaken including the testing steps, results and outcomes of each test and this should also include user story testing.
    - Whole CRUD operation was reviewed and fixed for publishing posts.
- The website needs to provide options for effective user actions, with relevant feedback for all user actions.
    - Whole CRUD operation was reviewed and fixed for publishing posts.


## Working Methodology

In order to achieve this second release, i review tasks and repair most of the mistakes that lead to a failure in the first place.

There's still more features to be implemented, having in mind an Agile mindset and stablishing goals to be completed within weekly iterations.

Placing myself in the user's position, and anticipating the user's wants and needs, i made myself the following questions:

Why would a user want to visit our blog?
What will make them return
What do i want to see when I visit a blog
What would make me return

From those answer I did set up 17 issues in GitHub as User Stories.

### User Stories

- EPICS
    - User Storys

- I can see photos posted by other users on this particular topic with no hassel.
    - As a user, I can see photos posted by other users so that i get interest on becoming a member.
    - As a user, I can see comments on each photo post so that i get interest on becoming a member.

## Moscow Prioritization
Which then i organized using Moscow prioritazion.

<img src="readme/moscow.png">

## Database Design
    
### Models

I will be using three diferent database models for this project: User, ImagePost and Comments,

The User class is the default User class from Django.

The ImagePost class is the key custom class in this project as the main function of the site is for users to share their own taken images, both inherit from models.Model.


class ImagePost(models.Model):

    title = models.CharField(max_length=200, unique=False)
    slug = models.SlugField(max_length=200, unique=True)
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='uploaded_images')
    author = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    image = CloudinaryField('image')
    location = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    text = models.TextField()
    excerpt = models.TextField()
    status = models.IntegerField(choices=STATUS, default=0)
    likes = models.ManyToManyField(User, related_name='image_likes', blank=True)



class Comment(models.Model):

    text = models.TextField()
    image_post = models.ForeignKey(ImagePost, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments')
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='comments_made')
    name = models.CharField(max_length=80)
    email = models.EmailField()
    created_on = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    approved = models.BooleanField(default=False)


### Database Relationships

I found is necessary to have two foreign keys in the Comment model to establish a relationship between the Comment model, the ImagePost model, and the User model.

The image_post foreign key in the Comment model is used to associate each comment with an specific image post. This creates a one-to-many relationship between the ImagePost model and the Comment model, as each ImagePost can have multiple Comment instances associated with it.

The user foreign key in the Comment model is used to track the user who made the comment. This creates a one-to-many relationship between the User model and the Comment model, as each User can have multiple Comment instances associated with it.

## Automated Testing

I did wrote three automates test following the Django Blog walkthru project, however i didn't had time to actually run them.

## CSS Validator
Css validator showed no errors.

## Lighthouse

## Project Creation Process

I created this project following both "Django Blog" and the "I Think Therefore I Blog projects".

I followed the stepst as Follows:

### In Gitpod:

1. Create a new repository in Github using Code's Institute template.
2. Install Django and gunicorn.
3. Install supporting libraries: pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2
4. Install Cloudinary Libraries: pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
5. Create requirements file: pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt

                INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ‚Ä¶
                'APP_NAME',
            ]
8. Inside bcristus/settings.py
    - Reference env.py (Note: font in bold is new)
            from pathlib import Path
            import os
            import dj_database_url
            if os.path.isfile("env.py"):
            import env

    - Remove the insecure secret key and replace - links to the SECRET_KEY variable on Heroku.
    - Comment out the old DataBases Section.
    - Add new DATABASES Section.
    - Save all files and Make Migrations.
    - Setup Cloudinary to store media and static files.
    - Link file to the templates directory in Heroku.
    - Change the templates directory to TEMPLATES_DIR
    - Add Heroku Hostname to ALLOWED_HOSTS
    
9. Create media, templates and static folders on top level directory
10. Create a Procfile on the top level directory and add web: gunicorn **bcristus**.wsgi
11. Allauth installed to create user login functionality and updated to requirements.txt
12. Crispyforms installed to allow members comment functionality and updated to requirements.txt.


### In Heroku:

1. Create a new external database
2. Create the Heroku app
3. Attach the database
4. Prepare our environment and settings.py file
5. Get our static and media files stored on Cloudinary.
6. Create new Heroku App.
7. Open the settings tab and Click Reveal Config Vars.
8. Add a Config Var called DATABASE_URL.
9. Add Cloudinary URL to Heroku Config Vars.
10. Add DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC to Heroku Config Vars.
11. Add Cloudinary Libraries to installed apps
12. Installed summernote and added to requirements via pip3 freeze, as editor for comments in backend.




### In ElephantSQL:

1. Log in to ElephantSQL and creaute an account.
2. Click ‚ÄúCreate New Instance‚Äù.
3. Select the Tiny Turtle (Free) plan.
4. Click ‚ÄúSelect Region‚Äù.
5. Check that your details are correct. Then click ‚ÄúCreate instance‚Äù
6. Return to the ElephantSQL dashboard and click on the database instance name for this project.
7. Copy your ElephantSQL database URL using the Copy icon. It will start with postgres://


### env.py

Inside the project directory there was an env.py file uploaded with the template; inside i did the following changes:

1. Import os library
2. Set environment variables
    - ["DATABASE_URL"]
    - ["SECRET_KEY"] 
    - ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]

## Deploy to Heroku

    Before final deployment, the debug setting in settings.py was set to false;

DEBUG = False

then the DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC config var in Heroku was removed, connect to github repository and 
deploy from branch, selected GitHub branch and clicked on Deploy button.



## Bugs

### Unfixed:

1. Overall code revision in order to make it more efficient, by loading small scripts without needing to update the whole page, when liking a post for example.


### Fixed

1. I tried to migrate my created models using an ImageField instead CloudinaryField to handle image's post; but terminal requested me to instal "Pillow" for Python to handle images.

2. I wanted to update my model for comments by adding name and email fields, i was getting this error once i tried to migrate; i solve it by typing 1, then true [^1]

3. I was getting an IntegrityError for trying to create an Object without loading properly the image. I changed the field-type in my model and updated the view; comments are stated in the code.


<img src="readme/null1.png">


4. After Crispyforms instalation and setup i wasn't able to render the website; i went thru the documentation and installed $ pip install crispy-bootstrap5 for bootstrap5.... and it worked.

5. I was having an error when  calling the text from the imagePost to be displayed in the Post Card, it showed the text with HTML sintax; however when i call excerpt shows correctly. I found out that i was using the word "content" which turned to be one of hte restricted python words; i change the field name in my model to text; and it worked.


## Features to Improve

- Allow members to create a PDF file from those post card; to be shared or even sent per post upon request.
- The fields in the PostCard, as well as messages could be printed, or not upon request of the member using checkboxes. 
- Members of the community will be able to also comment, edit and like other posts.
- Better placing the information for better UI performance.
- Allow visitors to Signup using social media.
- Allow members to update the post's location using geoTag.
- Visitors will be able to see the statue's location.
- Allow members to share the post images to their own social media.


## Credits

- All media content uploaded to the website belong to me.

## Acknowledgements

- First of all to my family, for allowing me the time to accomplish this classes.
- I'll like to give a credit to [Paul Thomas O'Riordan](https://github.com/paulie-o74) for hosting our weekly thursday meetings, and to "The people from the future", [Tony Albanese](https://github.com/tony-albanese), [Roshna Vakkeel](https://github.com/RoshnaVakkeel) and [Vivi Gnutz](https://github.com/vivignutz).

I found their guidance not just helpful but a "must" condition in order to organize the time and select wich contents to start learning. 

Without them it would have been totally unrealistic to complete this project in this timeframe.
- [Chuck Severance Youtube's channel.](https://www.youtube.com/@ChuckSeverance) With Mr. Severance i took a deeper diving into Database Models and MVC framework's theory.

Notes

[^1]: python3 manage.py makemigrations
You are trying to add a non-nullable field 'name' to comment without a default; we can't do that (the database needs something to populate existing rows)
Please select a fix:
 1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows with a null value for this column)
 2) Quit, and let me add a default in models.py
Select an option: 1
Please enter the default value now, as valid Python
The datetime and django.utils.timezone modules are available, so you can do e.g. timezone.now
Type 'exit' to exit this prompt
True.
