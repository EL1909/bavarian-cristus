Media
- All text and images belong to the developer.

## Acknowledgement

Actually, im not sure if i did use the grids correctly on my website. I will walk thru this lessons again. 

I am struggling with dates; im having 5 months to do this classes (wich i found amazing), however i haven't got enough time to work in this new knowledge and keeping up with the schedule.


Given the time and with a lot of practice, i'm confident i will become a software developer; even though i have beel failing all projects so far.
